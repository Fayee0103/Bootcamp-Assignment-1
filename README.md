# Wealthsimple - A Wealthtech Gem to Empower Financial Freedom

### Company Background ###

Wealthsimple is a Canadian online wealth management company founded by Michael Katchen in 2014. The goal of the company is to challenge the status quo of traditional financial institutions by offering a fuss-free and low-cost tool to invest and trade. Wealthsimple has 5 products: **Invest, Trade, Crypto, Cash and Tax**. Wealthsimple Invest leverage the artifical intelligence to help clients invest in a globally diversified low-cost ETF and maximize the best possible return based on clients' risk appetite through automatic rebalancing, dividend reinvesting, and tax loss harvesting. Wealthsimple trade is a commission-free trading platform where fractional share option is also available. Wealthsimple Crypto is the first Canada regulated crypto platform where you can trade cyptos, with an ambition to enable the real-world use of cryptocurrencies. In recent years,it also added the instant P2P money transfer tool and tax filing tool to complete its product portfolio. Wealthsimple has raised a total of $900.4M in funding over 9 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on May 3, 2021 from a Private Equity round. Based on the most recent disclosure, Power Corp of Canada (POW.TO) has 43% of its stakes.


### Business Activities ###

In the traditional banking industry, wealth management services, such as portfolio customization, automatic rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting are often exclusive to high networth individuals.Traditional banks typically have higher client acquisition cost, therefore they target clients who have established wealth so they can bring in more assets to justify banks' high trailing cost and operational expenses.  As a result, people with less savings, such as the younger generation or the lower income individuals, would be voluntarily excluded from the traditional wealth management service as they don’t meet the minimum balance requirement. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, Wealthsimple replaces the costly in-person advising work with cost-efficient algorithms to generate asset allocation advising tailored towards each client’s risk and return objectives as well as special needs (Halal investing). Through simplifying and automating the planning and advising process, Wealthsimple is able to achieve the economies of scale to cut cost and provide competitive wealth management services with no entry requirement, giving people’s freedom to invest and trade even with only 1 dollar.

Wealthsimple targets at the young investor market, mainly Millennials and Gen Z, who are tech-savvy and in the process of, or just starting, accumulating their wealth, and who might as well have an interest in cryptocurrency. According to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), approximately CAD$1 trillion in personal wealth will be transferred from one generation to the next in Canada between 2016 and 2026 resulting in a significant shift in investor demographics, in favor of millennials. In this sense, its TAM (total addressable market) is not only huge currently but also growing continuously. Wealthsimple is currently managing more than C$3 billion in total assets, hardly denting the 1 trillion shift towards the younger generation, let alone the overall $37-trillion asset management market in North America. However, for robo-advising alone, the addressable market could be much smaller relative to the total addressable market for asset management services.

Wealthsimple is facing competition from both the incumbents, the big 5 banks, as well as other fintech companies. The incumbents has been making effort to become digitized in order to cope with the changing demands by offering passive investment options and robo-advising tools, e.g. BMO smartfolio, RBC InvestEase, CI Direct Investing, etc. However, the application process and user interface are still not as “smart and quick” due to the legacy infrastructure. Additionally, banks are faced with higher trailing fees and operation cost, therefore their fee structure and balance requirement are hardly competitive. 
Aside from the incluments, Wealthsimple also sees challenges from other rising fintech companies, for example, Moka and Questrade in the robo-advising market, Bitbuy in the crypto market, and international competitors such as Wealthfront, Coinbase, Finance etc. Most of the fintech competitors focus on one or two aspects of the investment services, being crypto trading, stock trading, or robo-advising, which could be fragmented from a user experience perspective. By contrast, Wealthsimple has a complete set of product portfolio, making it a one-stop superapp with potential to deepen client relationships and tap into the full customer lifetime value - from everyday transaction, to tax filing, to wealth management.

The key technologies Wealthsimple uses include machine learning, cloud computing, and SaaS-based CRM. Machine learning algorithms, such as regressions and decision trees, using Python and SQL languages is the foundation of robo-advising tools. Github and PostgreSQL are the major platforms it uses to implement the code and data management.
Cloud computing is implemented using AWS, including Amazon RDS, SQS, S3, EC2, etc.  Salesforce is the key partner of Wealthsimple to implement CRM - managing company's relationships and interactions with customers. By using edge-cutting technologies and implementation tools, Wealthsimple is able to iterate the innovation process much faster and more efficiently than the large banks.

>“We push code to production many times a day. A bank operates on a code roll-out schedule that may be monthly, quarterly, annually, semi-annually. I think the more they can move towards an iterative process that enables true innovation and experimentation, instead of pushing these massive projects that were dreamed up in the boardroom with armies of consultants out the door, the better off they’ll be.” - Wealthsimple CEO

### Landscape ###

Wealthsimple competes in the market of wealth management, robo-advising and cryptocurrency trading. In this case study, I will focus mainly on its wealth management/robo-advising domain.
The wealthech market is forecasted to grow at 14.1% CAGR for the next 5 years. The robo-advising market, in particular, is projected to reach $41.07 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 31.8%. Assets under management are expected to show a CAGR of 16.72% by 2025.
In the past 10 years, there have been several notable trends in the wealth management industry. First of all, the increasing use of artificial intelligence in different verticals, especially finance analytics. Secondly, The number of Ultra HNI’s has been growing at roughly 12% to 16% each year in the last decade and their total wealth has been doubling roughly every 4 years, and those are some insane numbers. Thirdly, as the yields have been shrinking in the past decade, the investment yields also have come down from around 1.25%-1.5% to around 0.25% - 0.5% now, therefore, the margin in the wealth business has become smaller even though the asset size has gone up significantly. In this sense, robo-advising service as a more cost-efficient way of delivering investment advising services, is more likely to help improve the profitability of the business. Last but not the least, the past decade also saw that most of the development and innovations happened on the investment product side, such as global investment funds, REITs, Cryptocurrencies, variations of ETF’s, ESG funds, etc, whereas there hasn’t been much innovation on the overall financial service side until recent years when the one-stop superapp fintech companies emerged.

The landscape of wealthtech, robo-advising in particular, is quite competitive.There are two basic business models - B2B (selling products to other FIs) and B2C (selling products to customers directly). Besides Wealthsimple, other key players in Canada include Moka (acquired by Mogo Inc.), Responsive.AI (B2B). Canadian incumbents have also been developing in-house robo-advisors or acquiring the technology directly to keep up. 

The competition is even fiercer from a global perspective, U.S. companies such as Wealthfront (acquired by BNS), Betterment, Sofi, Personal Capital, and European fintech leaders as Scalable Capital, are as competitive, if not more so. These global players focus on the expansion and diversification of their market presence and therefore could be the largest threat to a local player like Wealthsimple. 

### Results ###

Wealthsimple is the first Canadian commission-free stock trading platform and the only one-stop financial service fintech company that offers passive investing, stock trading, crypto trading and wallets, and cash transfer services. It also plans to launch credit card products sometime in the near future. With innovative investment products (e.g. Halal Investing), lower fees, and better client experience, Wealthsimple disrupts the Canadian financial service industry monopolized by the traditional big banks. 

The profitability of robo-advising lies on its ability and opportunity to scale. Therefore, the number of users and AUM (assets under management) are important metrics to measure the growth and profitability of fintechs like Wealthsimple.

As of May 2021, it surpassed the 2 million user mark and recorded about $9.7 billion in AUM. In this most recent funding round, Wealthsimple is valued at $5 billion, more than triple the CAD$1.5 billion ($1.12 billion) valuation from the previous round. This offers another way to look at it - how much they are valued at the VC and PE firms.

Based on market data that is currently available, Wealthsimple has the largest client base (exceeded 2 million in May 2021) among Canadian wealthtech startups. Its biggest competitor, Mogo, has a 1.8 million member base as of November 2021, based on its most recent earning report. However, there’s no visibility into the revenue growth nor profitability of Wealthsimple as it hasn’t been publicly listed.

### Recommendations ###

To become a true one-stop financial service provider, I would suggest Wealthsimple to add payment/lending products to its services. There has been a huge tailwind towards the BNPL services, which can be an important feature added to Wealthsimple’s cash card service by providing installment payment options. Another opportunity lies in the secured lending segment, using stocks/cryptos pledged as collateral. Wealthsimple can leverage its investment clients, and turn them into “lending” clients at the same time. In other words, clients can pledge their holdings with Wealthsimple as collateral, either be stocks, ETFs or cryptos, and borrow against their value. This would be a win-win offers a new way for flexible financing to the clients and at the same time help the company to develop deeper relationship with the clients and tap into higher lifetime value.

Wealthsimple could automate and optimize the lending process by deploying an auto-underwriting and auto-funding engine. The underwriting and decisioning model utilize machine learning algorithms, e.g. decision tree, unsupervised clustering, to profile clients and build adjudication models. Smart contracts can also be leveraged to execute the funding process to ensure all the terms and conditions are met and validated.
